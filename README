This is the source code repository for "the Subversion book", also
known as "Version Control with Subversion".  This repository is
organized like so:

   trunk/

      This is where the bleeding-edge English original book material
      is developed, and includes the book's DocBook XML sources plus
      the tooling required to tranform those sources into more easily
      consumable formats (HTML, PDF, etc.)

   branches/

      Older versions of the English original book, plus various
      translations of those versions into other languages, live here.
      As with the trunk/ directory, each branch in this directory
      contains both book source files and copies of the build tools.

   wiki/

      This is the versioned store for the Google Code Project Hosting
      wiki tool used by this project at http://svnbook.googlecode.com/.

   www/

      Source material for the http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ (aka
      svnbook.org) website is housed here, including scripts for
      building and deploying the various versions of the book and its
      translations found in the trunk/ and branches/ directories.

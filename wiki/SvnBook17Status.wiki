#summary Status of the 1.7 version of the book.

= Version 1.7 Status =

There are no known major reorganizations required to update svnbook to cover Subversion 1.7.  However, the replacement of the old working copy library with the new WC-NG in Subversion 1.7 could necessitate fairly substantial section rewrites.  C. Michael Pilato plans to take the following multi-step approach to the task:

== Step 1: Review Release Notes ==

~~The Subversion project's [http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.7.html release notes] are generally pretty good at pointing out subtle (and major) behavior changes.  Check these for stuff missed elsewhere, and file appropriately milestones issues for changes that need to be made.~~

== Step 2: Review Issues ==

Review outstanding [http://code.google.com/p/svnbook/issues/list?q=label:Milestone-en-1.7 issues] marked for closure in this version.

== Step 3: Read-thru ==

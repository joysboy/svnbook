###  NOTE: The immediate children of the branches/ directory in this    ###
###  repository are not themselves copies of the trunk/.  Rather, they  ###
###  are placeholders for individual translations which themselves may  ###
###  or may not be copies of other translations.                        ###

If you wish to create a new translation branch, do the following:

1.  If there's no version collection directory ^/branches/X.Y for
    your translation, create one:

        svn mkdir ^/branches/X.Y \
            -m "Create collection directory for version X.Y translations"

    You'll want to initialize also the "tools" subdirectory of that
    new version collection, too:

        svn cp ^/trunk/tools ^/branches/X.Y/tools \
            -m "Make a copy of the latest tools for X.Y translations."

2.  Initialize your translation.  You might do this by copying the
    appropriate English version:

       svn cp ^/trunk/en ^/branches/X.Y/LOCALE \
           -m "Initialize LOCALE translation as a copy of the English"

    You might also use other sources for your translation, such as the
    previous version of your translation, or a clean import of new
    sources, etc.
